    <div class="pb-4" id="intro">Pennsylvanians! Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has <a
        href="https://www.ccrkba.org/ccrkba-warns-bloomberg-bought-virginia-now-hes-trying-to-buy-u-s/">committed $60
        million</a> to the cause of turning more than a dozen currently pro-gun states anti-gun in 2020. Pennsylvania
      is
      near the top of his hit list. This year, in addition to the presidential election, the entire PA House, half of the PA Senate, and the PA Attorney General's office are up for election. Bloomberg spent $2.5 million in 2019 to flip <a
        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VAGuns/">Virginia</a> from being equivalent to <a
        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PAGuns/">Pennsylvania</a> to equivalent to
      California in terms of <a href="https://vcdl.org/">our second amendment rights</a>. Now is the time for action!

              What does the Pennsylvania Committee of Correspondence hope to accomplish?</a>
          </h4>
        </div>
        <div id="question1" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
          <div class="panel-body">This committee exists to inform pro-gun voters of the need to vote and to get them to the polls. We are attempting to leverage network effects to spread the word to as many potential pro-gun voters as possible. <br><br>
            More specifically, we are operating under the hypothesis that most gun owners visit at least a gun store or a gun club several times a
            year. Thus, the Pennsylvania Committee of Correspondence proposes we organize these entities to spread the message that we
            must vote if we do not want to fight. This webpage exists to present potential members of the Committee of
            Correspondence and we need your helping including them. Visit your local gray map markers, explain the situation,
            and ask them to join the Committee of Correspondence today! All they have to do is provide a point of contact,
            receive three points of information building up to the election, and share this information with every potential
            pro-gun voter they come into contact with. <a href="mailto:info@pagunvote.com">Email us</a> (1) when you've
            contacted a gray marker, (2) when they've agreed to be included and provided an email address, or (3) refuse to
            join
            our efforts to protect our rights. When you email us about a specific marker (include the address in your email)
            we'll update the marker in our map. <br><br>
            It is important that you email us for any one of those cases. With a collection of email addresses belonging to
            supporters, we'll turn the wheels of victory by:<br><br>
            <ol class="centered-list">
              <li>Emailing the committee information about registering to vote.</li>
              <li>Emailing the committee the <a href="https://foac-pac.org/">FOAC</a> Voter Guide for 2020 when it is ready.
              </li>
              <li>Emailing the committee information about when and where to vote.</li>
            </ol>

            Committee members will take this data and spread it to every pro-gun voter they can find, be it neighbors,
            friends,
            customers, colleagues, etc.

            If we band together we can win. Let's turn this entire map green!

          <div class="panel-body">The short answer is any way that plays to your strengths, but here are some ideas, starting with the most valuable:<br><br>
            <ul>
             <li>Convince anyone you know that is pro-gun and sits out elections that they need to vote and vote pro-gun. Explain to them what is going on in Virginia and how we'll be in the same situation in January 2021 otherwise. Help them register to vote and offer to drive them to their polling place if necessary.</li>
             <li>Pick some gray markers near you, visit them, and convince them to join the committee. If you really can't visit in person, consider making a phone call instead.</li>
             <li>Attend a gun show and hand out <a href="files/flyer_general.pdf">flyers</a>. Heck, get a table and tell everyone who walks by what Bloomberg is trying to do to our state and what they can do about it.</li>
             <li>Join a local gun rights group and contribute.</li>
             <li>Help spread the word on the Internet.</li>
             <li>Help change the rhetoric on the gun forums from passive whining to a bias towards action. Instead of whining, what are you going to do about it? Share with others. They just might be inspired to act themselves.</li>
             <li>Help us improve the content and looks of the website and our flyers. Help make flyers for additional audiences.</li>

          <div class="panel-body">My name is [YOUR FULL NAME] I am calling/visiting on behalf of the Pennsylvania Committee of Correspondence. We are a grassroots, Pro-gun, voter registration campaign here in Pennsylvania.<br><br>
            I am not reaching out today to ask for any contributions or donations, we do not do that. I am simply looking to spread awareness regarding the importance of the elections this November, specifically regarding our second amendment rights.<br><br>
            Are you aware the entire PA House and half of the PA Senate are up for re-election this year?<br><br>
            (Listen to response)<br><br>
            (If they do not mention Bloomberg) Are you also aware of what is going on in Virginia and that Bloomberg has pledged millions of dollars to flip the PA legislature anti-gun this year, just like he did in Virginia last year?<br><br>
            (Listen to response)<br><br>
            We're trying to prevent Pennsylvania from falling like Virginia has, and we believe our best bet is to get out the vote. Bloomberg's $50 billion is more than we can outspend.<br><br>
            The Committee of Correspondence is contacting all Pennsylvania FFLs and asking if they are willing to become Committee members to help spread the word. Do you want to learn more real quick?<br><br>
            (If "No" thank them for their time/ask if another time is better/move on)<br><br>
            (If "Yes") To become a Committee member we are only asking that you provide a point of contact (preferably an e-mail address). We'll then use this contact to deliver three points of information building up to the election. All we ask is that committee members share this information with every potential pro-gun voter they come into contact with.<br><br>
            The three points of information are as follows:<br><br>
            <ol>
             <li>How individuals can register to vote.</li>
             <li>(Once it is ready) The Firearm Owners Against Crime pro-gun voter guide.</li>
             <li>As the election approaches, information about when and where to vote.</li>

          <div class="panel-body">We downloaded a spreadsheet of FFL data for the state from <a href="https://www.atf.gov/firearms/listing-federal-firearms-licensees">ATF's website</a>. We then curated the data by going through every row and deleting those that: <br><br>
            <ul>
             <li>Did not have a business name entry or whose license name was a person's name and not a business's.</li>
             <li>Belong to a big box store such was Walmart or Dick's.</li>
             <li>Have a business name that implied the business doesn't necessarily cater to a majority pro-gun audience.</li>
            </ul> 
            Once the data was curated, we used the code on our <a href="https://github.com/phrack/firearms_map/">GitHub repository</a> to convert the data from a spreadsheet to JSON so that it can be displayed on the map above.

        <div id="question5" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
          <div class="panel-body">Please see the answer to the question about how the map was created for more details. In short, our process for adding points to the map was intended to weed out cases where an FFL does not have a store front or does not cater to a majority pro-gun audience. For many reasons, this might have caused us to delete your favorite entity.<br><br>
            For example, sometimes people get an FFL without a business name, then create a business later. In these cases the FFL is assigned to an individual at their private residence. We have no way of knowing if those licensees want random people showing up at their house.<br><br> 
            Similarly, many people own unrelated businesses such as construction, landscaping, jewelry, etc. that they got an FFL for reasons we can only guess at. Either way, we have no way to know if they have a store front catering to a majority pro-gun audience and therefore removed it.<br><br>
            If we removed any entry in error, send their business name, address, and phone number to <a href="mailto:info@pagunvote.com">info@pagunvote.com</a> and we'll gladly add it. Same goes for sportsman's clubs.
